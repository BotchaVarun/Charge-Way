Act as a senior Android application architect and EV mobility domain expert. Design a complete Android application with proper UI flow, backend logic, APIs, data models, and algorithms.

🧠 Application Overview

Build an Electric Vehicle (EV) Charging Station Recommendation Android Application that helps EV users plan trips intelligently by recommending charging stations based on battery State of Charge (SOC), vehicle mileage, and route distance.

The app should support user authentication, vehicle-specific configurations, real-time route planning, and automatic + manual EV charging station stops.

🚗 Home / Dashboard Screen (After Login)
Display User & Vehicle Information

EV Car Model

Battery State of Charge (SOC %) (mock or real-time API)

Estimated Remaining Range (km) calculated as:

Remaining Range = (Current SOC % / 100) × Max Mileage


Estimated Time to Full Charge

Charging Speed (fast/normal – optional)

Account Info (Profile, Logout)

🗺️ Map & Navigation Module (Second Page)
Features:

Google Maps integration

Current location detection

Search bar with two options:

🔍 Enter destination address (text input)

📍 Select destination by pin on map

📍 Route Planning & Distance Calculation

Once destination is selected:

Display route from current location → destination

Show:

Total distance (km)

Estimated travel time

Calculate if journey is possible with current battery SOC

⚡ EV Charging Station Recommendation Logic
Automatic Stop Recommendation

If:

Remaining Range < Total Distance


Then:

Identify EV charging stations along the route

Filter stations:

Within reachable range based on current SOC

Located close to the route path

Automatically add charging stops in between

Recalculate:

Distance between each stop

Battery SOC usage

Charging time at each station

📌 Example Logic:

Battery SOC = 10%

Max Mileage = 100 km

Remaining Range = 10 km

Journey Distance = 20 km
→ App automatically inserts nearest EV station within first 10 km of route.

➕ Manual Charging Station Selection

Allow users to:

View all nearby EV stations

Manually add or remove charging stops

Update route dynamically after manual changes
